/****************************************************************************
 * Name: reset_ipc_register
 *
 * Description:
 *   Register a channel, exposing the peer core to the reset framework so it
 *   can be reset through reset_control_* and joining the framework's
 *   panic/reboot fan-out on the calling core.
 *
 *   Call before the transport starts delivering notifications, and from the
 *   core that owns the channel.  Balance with reset_ipc_unregister() from
 *   the stop path: the reset controller registration is not idempotent.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   ipc     - The channel embedded in the transport private data
 *   ops     - Transport callbacks, must stay valid while registered
 *   cpuname - Peer cpu name, used for log messages and as the reset
 *             controller device name.  Not copied.
 *   status  - Address of a uint32_t pair shared with the peer, same memory
 *             on both sides.  Word 0 is written by the master, word 1 by the
 *             slave, each core reading only the other's.  Must be uint32_t
 *             aligned and non-cacheable (the words share a cache line), and
 *             ideally survive a peer reset so the status stays readable.
 *   master  - True on the master core, false on the slave.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   OK on success, with ipc->rstc ready for reset_control_reset_reason();
 *   reset_ipc_unregister() puts it.  A negated errno on failure, which
 *   leaves nothing registered, so there is nothing to undo.
